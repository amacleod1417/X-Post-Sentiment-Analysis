# X-Post-Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the automated process of identifying and classifying subjective information in text data. This might be an opinion, a judgment, or a feeling about a particular topic or product feature. This model, built using python and pandas frameworks, takes in X posts and outputs their sentiment as positive or negative. This sentiment analysis tool uses Natural Language Processing to make sense of human language, and machine learning to automatically deliver accurate results. The sentiment analysis model was trained and tested on its accuracy. Being able to analyze social media posts in real-time, and determine the sentiment that underlies each message, adds a new dimension to social media monitoring. For example, it could be used in marketing and entrepreneurship to keep track of whatâ€™s being said about your product or service on social media, and can help you detect angry customers or negative mentions before they they escalate. Yes, you could sort data by sentiment manually, but what happens when your data starts to grow? Sentiment analysis with machine learning is simple, fast, and scalable, and can provide consistent results with a high level of accuracy.
